# Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the following task to complete the elections audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast. 
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total nubmer of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Date Source: election_results.csv
- Software : Python 3.7.6, Visual Code 1.63.2
- 
## Summary
The Analysis of the election show that:
- There were a total of 369,711 votes
- There candidates were:
   -Charles Casper Stockham
    -Diana DeGette
    -Raymon Anthony Doane
 - The candidate results were:
    -Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
    -Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,696)
    -Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
-The winner of the election was:
    -Winner: Diana DeGette
    -Winning Vote Count: 272,892
    -Winning Percentage: 73.8%

## Challange Overview
-The overview of this project began with importing data from election_result file to Python to analyze and    calculate the total number of votes to determine the percentage of votes each of the three candidates recieved and determine the winning candidate.  After a code was developed to produce percentage results the go ahead was given to read election results which was produced in a Text File format. 

## Challange Summary 
- My findings indicate that Dianna DeGette won a sigificant proportion of the popular vote and winning with a margin of over three times her closest canididate.  Diane DeGette appears to have more backing and support in Colorado than her peers which is clearly shown in the latest congressional election.
